# leave_me_alone
An app to get people to leave you alone while you're disconnecting from society

The app has two parts:
  1. you click a button to bring up a randomly generated quote from a database of sad emo quotes to display in your facebook feed.  Thus, making sure that your friends will leave you alone for the selected amount of days.

  2. If you would like to add your own sappy emo quote to the database, you can type in your quote in the input below, and then click submit to post your sappy emo quote to facebook.

  3. After your post is complete, enjoy a few days of being left alone.  Because no one wants to get involved with someone having emo mcr moments.
